            What are the different ways to manage a state in a React

              When we talk about state in our applications, it’s important to be
              clear about what types of state actually matter. There are four
              main types of state you need to properly manage in your React
              apps: Local state Global state Server state URL state Let's cover
              each of these in detail: Local (UI) state – Local state is data we
              manage in one or another component. Local state is most often
              managed in React using the useState hook. For example, local state
              would be needed to show or hide a modal component or to track
              values for a form component, such as form submission, when the
              form is disabled and the values of a form’s inputs. Global (UI)
              state – Global state is data we manage across multiple components.
              Global state is necessary when we want to get and update data
              anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least. A common
              example of global state is authenticated user state. If a user is
              logged into our app, it is necessary to get and change their data
              throughout our application. Sometimes state we think should be
              local might become global. Server state – Data that comes from an
              external server that must be integrated with our UI state. Server
              state is a simple concept, but can be hard to manage alongside all
              of our local and global UI state. There are several pieces of
              state that must be managed every time you fetch or update data
              from an external server, including loading and error state.
              Fortunately there are tools such as SWR and React Query that make
              managing server state much easier. URL state – Data that exists on
              our URLs, including the pathname and query parameters. URL state
              is often missing as a category of state, but it is an important
              one. In many cases, a lot of major parts of our application rely
              upon accessing URL state. Try to imagine building a blog without
              being able to fetch a post based off of its slug or id that is
              located in the URL! There are undoubtedly more pieces of state
              that we could identify, but these are the major categories worth
              focusing on for most applications you build.

            <p>The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.</p>

          What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
          </div>
          <div className="collapse-content">
            <p>A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property. The isolated part of the definition is important.
For Test-Driven Development (TDD), we write unit tests before writing any implementation. This makes our implementation details in our code shorter and easier to understand. In this instance, the best time to write unit tests is immediately. For others, most developers write unit tests after the code's been written.</p>

          React vs. Angular vs. Vue?
          </div>
          <div className="collapse-content">
            <p>If the choice you’re making is based on Angular vs React alone, then you’ll simply need to consider the pros and cons discussed for those libraries in this post. But overall, keep in mind that both libraries can be used for mobile and web apps, while Angular is generally better for more complex apps that are enterprise-ready.
React often requires extra modules and components, which keeps the core library small, but means there’s extra work involved when incorporating outside tools. Angular, on the other hand, is more of a full-fledged solution that doesn’t require extras like React often does, though it does have a steeper learning curve for its core compared to React.
React is more suitable for intermediate to advanced JavaScript developers who are familiar with concepts from ES6 and up, while Angular favors those same developers who are also familiar with TypeScript.
 React vs Vue

The choice between React vs Vue is often debated and it’s not an easy one. Vue has a vibrant and ever-growing community and has taken over popularity vs. React in many respects. React developers are still churning out lots of new components and extras, so there’s no sign that React is on the decline either.

Vue is generally more suited to smaller, less complex apps and is easier to learn from scratch compared to React. Vue can be easier to integrate into new or existing projects and many feel its use of HTML templates along with JSX is an advantage.

Overall, Vue might be the best choice if you’re a newer developer and not as familiar with advanced JavaScript concepts, while React is quite well suited for experienced programmers and developers who have worked with object-oriented JavaScript, functional JavaScript, and similar concepts.
Angular vs Vue-In most cases, you probably wouldn’t be deciding between only Angular and Vue. They are vastly different libraries with very different feature sets and learning curves. Vue is the clear choice for less experienced developers, and Angular would be preferred for those working on larger apps.

A large library like Angular would require more diligence in keeping up with what’s new, while Vue would be less demanding in this regard and the fact that the two most recent major releases of Vue are in separate repositories helps.

It should also be noted that Vue was created by a developer who formerly worked on Angular for Google, so that’s another thing to keep in mind, though that wouldn’t have a huge impact on your decision.
